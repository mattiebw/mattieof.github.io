    <p class="mb-6">23rd January 2025</p>
    <p class="font-bold mb-6">Dear Sara Machado,</p>
    <p>As a second-year BSc Computer Games Technology student at the University of Portsmouth, I am eager to bring my
      strong skills in C++ & C# programming and passion for game development to the team at Unity.</p>
    <p class="mt-2">Over the past 3 years, I have developed my programming skills through multiple personal and academic
      projects. For instance, Pirate Survivors was an Unreal Engine project in which I helped create a multiplayer
      survivors-like, for which I designed robust and performant systems on top of Unreal Engine's replication system,
      allowing us to replicate hundreds of experience item drops. As well as that, I used the engine's reflection system
      to allow designers to easily create upgrades from available properties. Furthermore, I have recently been working
      on a small 2D shooter as the team lead. It is written in C++ and has a custom preprocessor tool written in C#,
      with OpenGL for rendering, Steamworks for networking, FMOD for audio, and more. The project has required me to help
      programmers new to C++ implement features into systems I designed, giving me experience in supporting programmers
      and solving problems with the help of other people.</p>
    <p class="mt-2">Previously, I have worked in Unity to create multiple game jam games, both 2D and 3D. Furthermore,
      I recently learned Godot for a short-term project, proving that I am quickly able to learn new technologies. Both
      engines use C# for scripting, which is also a language I use a lot in personal projects outside of games development.
      My interest in lower-level technologies, as well as higher-level games programming, aligns well with a role at Unity -
      I believe it may give me the opportunity to explore the intricacies of lower-level games technologies more deeply.</p>
    <p class="mt-2">I believe these experiences make me a good fit for a Software Engineer role at Unity - they
      have not only solidified my technical knowledge, but the multiple group projects have taught me the importance of
      collaboration - I'd love to work along designers, artists, and other programmers to help achieve a creative vision fully.
      I agree with Unity's value of putting its users first, and I am interested in working to help the engine's users to
      get the most out of the engine. Furthermore, I believe Unity's culture of equal voices, and willingness to learn from others
      is perfect for my goal of developing my skills within a professional environment, while also contributing
      to existing, strong teams.</p>
    <p class="mt-2">I am available to commence a full-time placement in the summer of 2025, willing to relocate
      (especially to Brighton, which I've loved the times I have been), and am eligible
      to work in the UK without the need for Visa sponsorship. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills
      and experiences align with the needs of your team.</p>
    <p class="mt-2">Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to games
      with passionate, creative, and collaborative teams, and developing my skills at Unity.</p>
    <p class="mt-10">Sincerely,</p>
    <p class="mt font-bold">Matt Ware</p>
